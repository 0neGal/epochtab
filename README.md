# Epoch Tab
Epoch Tab is a lightweight new tab, with a live UNIX Epoch on screen.

The tab is customizable and therefore you can:
* Change the background color
* Change the text color
* Enable or disable "seconds since january 1st"
* Enable or disable having a normal 24hr or 12hr clock under

### _**NOTE: I haven't added customization just yet, but it's planned if I don't abandon the project**_
